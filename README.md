## Welcome 👋

This is a solution to the [Browser extensions manager UI challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/browser-extension-manager-ui-yNZnOfsMAp). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this browser extension manager UI and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the extensions in a local data.json file. So you can use that to add the data dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
Filter active and inactive extensions
Remove extensions from the list
Select their color theme
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
